# Region Profiles — the market adapter

> **Safety-critical.** A wrong emergency number or a missing consent gate is a legal
> and physical-safety failure. Implements PLAT-1.
> See [ADR-0011](../adr/0011-region-profile-adapter.md).

> ⚠️ **Every legal and regulatory statement below must be confirmed with qualified

## Why this exists

The launch market is deliberately deferred, so **no market-specific value may be
hard-coded anywhere**. Everything a market changes resolves through one profile:
emergency numbers, providers, languages, consent copy, retention, pricing, recording
law, dispatch availability.

The two reference profiles are **Pakistan** and **US** — chosen because they differ
on nearly every axis, which is the only way to prove the abstraction is real rather
than a wrapper around one market's assumptions.

**Hard gate:** a market cannot be enabled until its profile is complete and
`legalReviewStatus === 'approved'`. Enforced in code at boot, not by process.

## 1. The contract

```ts
interface RegionProfile {
  id: string; // 'PK' | 'US'
  displayName: string;
  status: "draft" | "in-review" | "approved" | "disabled";
  legalReviewStatus: "pending" | "approved";
  legalReviewedAt?: string;
  legalReviewedBy?: string;

  emergency: {
    numbers: EmergencyNumber[]; // ordered by relevance
    dialPolicy: "user-initiated-only" | "auto-dial-permitted";
    dispatchPartner?: DispatchPartner; // usually undefined
    canClaimDispatch: boolean; // false unless a signed agreement exists
  };

  messaging: {
    smsProvider: ProviderRef | null;
    voiceProvider: ProviderRef | null;
    deviceDirectSmsAllowed: boolean;
    recipientConsentRequired: boolean; // consent from the CONTACT, not the user
    registrationRequired?: string; // e.g. US 10DLC / A2P brand+campaign
    channels: ChannelCapability[]; // see DELIVERY_LEDGER.md
  };

  recording: {
    audioConsent:
      "one-party" | "all-party" | "varies-subnational" | "prohibited";
    subnationalOverrides?: Record<string, "one-party" | "all-party">;

### The six fields that are easy to get fatally wrong

| Field                                 | Why it matters                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `emergency.numbers`                   | Dialling the wrong number in an emergency. Also changes while roaming                         |
| `emergency.canClaimDispatch`          | Gates all UI copy implying official dispatch. Default `false`                                 |
| `messaging.recipientConsentRequired`  | Consent is needed from the **contact**, not the user — the opposite of most product intuition |
| `recording.audioConsent`              | In all-party jurisdictions, recording without consent can be a **criminal offence**           |
| `privacy.locationIsSensitiveCategory` | Changes the legal basis, disclosures and opt-out machinery                                    |
| `locale.rtl`                          | Urdu is RTL. An emergency screen with broken layout is a functional failure                   |

## 2. Profile: Pakistan (`PK`)

```yaml
id: PK
displayName: Pakistan
status: draft
legalReviewStatus: pending # BLOCKS enablement

emergency:
  numbers:
    - { number: "15", label: "Police", scope: national }
    - {
        number: "1122",
        label: "Rescue / Emergency Service",
        scope: subnational,
        regions: [Punjab],
      }
    - { number: "115", label: "Ambulance (Edhi)", scope: national }
    - { number: "130", label: "Motorway Police", scope: national }
  dialPolicy: user-initiated-only
  dispatchPartner: null
  canClaimDispatch: false

messaging:
  smsProvider: local-aggregator # TBD — see open questions
  voiceProvider: null
  deviceDirectSmsAllowed: true
  recipientConsentRequired: true # product policy, stricter than local law
  registrationRequired: null # confirm PTA masking/sender-ID rules
  channels: [push, sms, device-direct-sms, web]

recording:
  audioConsent: varies-subnational # CONFIRM WITH COUNSEL
  requiresOnScreenNotice: true
  requiresAudibleNotice: false

privacy:
  regimes: [PECA-2016, PDP-draft] # data-protection statute still evolving — confirm status
  locationIsSensitiveCategory: true # product policy regardless of statute
  minorConsentAge: 18 # conservative default pending review
  dataResidency: null # confirm localisation requirements
  retention:
    { locationDays: 30, audioDays: 30, videoDays: 90, incidentYears: 2 }
  erasureSlaDays: 30

locale:
  languages: [ur, en]
  default: ur
  rtl: true # ← drives full RTL layout work

commerce:

  - PSCA NextGen Safety App
```

### Pakistan-specific engineering consequences

1. **RTL is mandatory, not optional.** Urdu as default means every safety-critical
   screen must be verified in RTL. A mirrored SOS button or clipped countdown is a
   functional defect, not cosmetic. This is the single largest Pakistan-specific
   engineering cost and it lands in Phase 1, not Phase 6.
2. **Subnational emergency numbers.** `1122` is Punjab's rescue service; the profile
   must resolve by region, not country. The emergency number is a **function of
   current location**, not of account country.
3. **Official apps already occupy part of the space.** PSCA's apps provide emergency
   connectivity, consultation, legal and psychological support. Lumo must not
   position as an alternative official dispatch service — differentiate on
   cross-platform journeys, trusted-contact coordination, verified delivery and
   privacy, and explore complementary partnership.
4. **Device-direct SMS matters more.** Patchier data coverage makes the SIM-based
   fallback a primary path rather than a last resort. Prioritise its UX.
5. **Lower willingness to pay.** Price points above are hypotheses in PKR and must be
   validated locally; do not convert USD pricing.
6. **Literacy and iconography.** Do not assume text-first comprehension. Safety-
   critical actions need icon + colour + text redundancy.

### US-specific engineering consequences

1. **All-party consent recording is a release blocker for evidence capture.** In
   roughly a dozen states, recording a conversation without every party's consent can
   be a **criminal offence** — committed by the _user_, in a moment of crisis,
   because our app started recording. This is the most serious finding in this
   document.

   **Therefore:** `recording.audioConsent` resolves by the device's **current
   location**, not billing address. In an all-party jurisdiction the default is
   video-without-audio or an explicit one-time consent prompt, and the product must
   never silently start audio capture. Counsel must advise on whether an emergency
   exception applies — do not assume one does.

2. **A2P 10DLC registration gates launch.** Brand and campaign registration must
   complete before any SMS sends, with per-campaign throughput limits that directly
   constrain fan-out. This is weeks of lead time and belongs on the critical path.

3. **Recipient consent for messaging.** Consent must come from the **contact**, which
   is why RES-7 exists. A user cannot consent on another person's behalf.

4. **Precise geolocation as sensitive data** brings disclosure, opt-out and
   limited-use obligations, plus a Data Safety declaration that must match reality.

5. **No unilateral 911 integration.** PSAPs do not generally accept automated
   third-party alerts. The realistic path is a dispatch partner behind
   `DispatchPartner`, under contract. Until then `canClaimDispatch: false` and no copy
   may imply otherwise.

6. **Highest SMS cost of the two markets**, which makes PLAT-5's spend cap an
   economic necessity, not just abuse control.

7. **COPPA at 13** requires an age gate and verifiable parental consent for family
   plans with minors.

## 4. What the two profiles prove

The abstraction is only real if these differences are pure configuration:

| Axis                       | PK                    | US                          | Must be config, not code        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Emergency number           | 15 / 1122 subnational | 911 national                | ✅ resolved by current location |
| Layout direction           | **RTL**               | LTR                         | ✅                              |
| Recording consent          | varies                | **all-party in ~12 states** | ✅ resolved by current location |
| Messaging pre-registration | TBD                   | **10DLC required**          | ✅                              |
| Currency / price           | PKR 299               | USD 4.99                    | ✅                              |
| Incident retention         | 2 years               | 7 years                     | ✅                              |
| Erasure SLA                | 30 days               | 45 days                     | ✅                              |
| Dispatch available         | no                    | partner-only                | ✅                              |
| Primary competitors        | PSCA apps             | Google, Life360             | ✅ (content, not code)          |

If any row requires a code branch rather than a profile value, the abstraction has
failed and must be fixed before a third market is added.

---

## 5. Resolution order

The profile in force is resolved per request and per emergency, in this order:

1. **Device current location** (most accurate; required for emergency number and
   recording consent)
2. Last known location, with its age surfaced
3. SIM / network country
4. Account country
5. Global safe default

**Rule:** emergency numbers and recording-consent rules resolve from **location**,
never from the account. A Californian travelling in Pakistan must get `15`, and a
Pakistani user in Illinois must get all-party recording rules.

When location is unavailable, show the account-country number **labelled with that
uncertainty** — "Showing Pakistan emergency numbers; we couldn't confirm your
location."

---

## 6. Enablement checklist

A market stays `draft` until every box is ticked:

- [ ] Emergency numbers verified, including subnational variants
- [ ] `canClaimDispatch` set, with the agreement referenced if `true`
- [ ] SMS/voice provider contracted; registration complete; cost per message recorded
- [ ] Channel capability matrix populated (which channels report receipts here)
- [ ] Recording-consent rules confirmed, including subnational overrides
- [ ] Privacy regimes mapped; retention and erasure SLA set
- [ ] Minor-consent age and parental-consent flow defined
- [ ] All safety-critical copy translated **and reviewed by a native speaker**
- [ ] RTL verified on every safety-critical screen, if applicable
- [ ] Pricing validated locally — not converted
- [ ] Public alert feeds confirmed programmatically available
- [ ] `legalReviewStatus: approved`, with reviewer and date
- [ ] Store data-safety disclosures updated for the market
- [ ] Failure-mode tests re-run on local networks and devices

## 7. Required tests

| Scenario                               | Expected                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Profile incomplete                     | Market cannot be enabled; boot-time assertion fails loudly         |
| `legalReviewStatus: pending`           | Enablement refused regardless of other fields                      |
| US user in California starts recording | All-party rules applied; audio not captured silently               |
| PK user in Punjab triggers SOS         | `1122` offered alongside `15`                                      |
| PK user in Sindh                       | `1122` not offered; `15` and `115` are                             |
| User roams PK → US mid-journey         | Emergency number updates from location, not account                |
| Location unavailable                   | Account-country numbers shown **with the uncertainty stated**      |
| `canClaimDispatch: false`              | No UI string implies official dispatch                             |
| Urdu selected                          | Every safety-critical screen correct in RTL; countdown not clipped |
| Spend cap with PK vs US SMS cost       | Cap enforced in minor units of the correct currency                |

---

## 8. Open questions for counsel and operations

**Pakistan** — current status of the data-protection statute and its obligations ·
audio-recording consent, including any subnational variation · PTA rules for A2P
sender IDs and masking · whether PSCA partnership or data sharing is possible ·
whether any data-localisation requirement applies.

**US** — whether an emergency exception exists to all-party recording consent, per
state (**blocks Phase 2 evidence capture if unresolved**) · 10DLC brand/campaign
scope and throughput for emergency traffic · whether emergency alerts to a
pre-consented contact sit outside standard messaging-consent constraints · dispatch
partner terms and liability allocation · state-by-state comprehensive-privacy
applicability thresholds.

**Both** — liability for a missed or delayed alert · whether an incident export is
admissible, and what must be added if not · insurance requirements before any
volunteer or responder feature.
