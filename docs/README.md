## The three things to know before touching anything

1. **The SOS screen contacts nobody.** It says "Emergency Calling…", renders a
   _hardcoded_ contact ring and "Notifying Nearby Volunteers…", and performs no call,
   SMS, push or location upload.
2. **There are no real coordinates.** Hazard reports are CSS percentages over a JPEG,
   and the server _invents_ the position of every report.
3. **`pnpm typecheck` is a silent no-op** — all 8 turbo tasks resolve to
   `<NONEXISTENT>`, so it exits 0 having checked nothing.

The parts that _are_ real — sensor hooks, module boundaries, shared types, AI
fallbacks, test suites — are well built. The gap is that the response half of the
product was built as UI first.

## Keeping these honest

This repo once shipped an audit claiming Prisma migrations were tracked when
`prisma/migrations/` had never existed. That is the failure mode to avoid.

- Update the relevant doc **in the same PR** as the code
- When a mock becomes real, [`audit/FEATURES.md`](audit/FEATURES.md) changes **first**
- Verify before asserting: read the file, then write the sentence
- The `lumo-docs` skill runs the ID, link and format checks
