# Requirements Audit

## The headline finding

**The original requirements document described a different application.** It
referenced `useAudioRecorder`, `navigator.mediaDevices`, `SpeechSynthesis` and
`DeviceMotionEvent.requestPermission` — browser APIs from an earlier **web**
prototype. None exist in the React Native codebase. Behaviour it described as working
(audio recording on SOS, spoken self-defence tips, an alarm sound, a ringtone) **is
not implemented at all**.

| Claim in that document                                                  | Reality                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Immediately starts recording audio using `useAudioRecorder`"           | No such hook exists — verified absent                   |
| "uses the browser's `SpeechSynthesis` API… a loud alarm is also played" | Neither exists; `expo-speech`/`expo-av` not installed   |
| "simulates an incoming call screen with a ringtone"                     | Screen yes, ringtone no                                 |
| "Microphone requested via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`"        | Browser API; RN uses `app.json` + the voice plugin      |
| "`DeviceMotionEvent.requestPermission`… Safari on iOS"                  | Browser API; RN uses `expo-sensors`                     |
| "Power button 3 times"                                                  | **Impossible** for a third-party app on either platform |
| "`/api/auth/login`", "`/api/danger-zones`"                              | Actual routes are `/api/v1/…`                           |

**Tally: 4 complete (13%) · 6 partial (20%) · 20 pending (67%).**

## The structural finding

Every ✅ is a **trigger** or an **escape tool**. Every item in the **response** chain —
notify, locate, record, dispatch — is ⛔.

> The app can detect that you are in trouble four different ways, and then does
> nothing about it.

The engineering quality where the app is real is high: the sensor hooks, module
boundaries, shared types, AI fallbacks and test suites are solid. The gap is not craft
— the response half was built as UI first. That is the defining fact of this codebase,
and the reason the PRD exists.
